# Quick Start

- Clone the [Seed Project](http://github.com/walmartlabs/thorax-seed) and start building your own application.
- Read about how Thorax works in the new [Backbone Fundamentals Book](http://addyosmani.github.com/backbone-fundamentals/#thorax).
- Install the [Thorax Inspector](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/thorax-inspector/poioalbefcopgeaeaadelomciijaondk) Chrome extension.
- Building something smaller? Just link the [core library](http://github.com/walmartlabs/thorax) as a [single file from cdnjs](http://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/thorax/2.0.0rc6/thorax.js) compiled with all of its dependencies and use it anywhere or play with our [Hello World fiddle](http://jsfiddle.net/KRuPZ/) or [Todos fiddle](http://jsfiddle.net/mZzhy/).
